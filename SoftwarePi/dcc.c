 * This is an implementation of a complete DCC sender for the Raspberry Pi.
 * These functions emulate the basic DCC functionality. Support for extended
 * packets may be added in the future.
 *
 * Signals are generated via bit-banging. Timing is controlled by a periodic
 * real-time task that toggles the sending GPIO.
